***So How to handle a tech blog ?***
1. Proper Titles:
Titles need to promote the article without sensationalizing it. When writing technical blog posts, it’s important to be accurate in the title and summarize the content and purpose of your post.

There are three easy ways to make your titles more appealing, and these all lend themselves well to technical blogging:
- Catchy Titles
- Use current Trends
- Using numbers and figures to make it more Prominent

2. Topics:
The Internet is filled with som or the other news related to the recent development in technologies. As soon as a new development is announced every blogger is head on heals on it to be the first one to cover it. You dont need to be the gut screming "First" on the internet but you need to be effective with how much reach your article can achieve.

As soon as a development is announced you need to cover the topic before 2 days or before the fad dies down. Being efficient with it is the key.

Knowing your audience is also of utmost important because you also need to pitch your content at the right level. There’s no point in using your blog to market your development skills if you essentially write guides for fellow coders.

3. Do Your Research:
Authenticity and Accuracy is very essential when producing technical blogs. It’s important that you perform a research phase to map out your idea before heading down to publishing it.

Even if you’re an expert on a particular subject, it’s still sensible to check out other material so you can add something new to the debate. Unique ideas will make your content more valuable. Avoid linking to old research or sources, unless you’re writing about a legacy technology. Your definition of “old” may vary to someone else’s. But in general, try not to link to content that is more than three years old.

4. Make your Own Unique Impact:
Having a unique writing style clearly defines you from other tech bloggers around you. Pay attention to your own style and make your writing accessible. When you’re blogging, presenting facts isn’t enough. Good technical blogs are enjoyable to read without compromising on technical detail. Read some competitor blogs to figure out how you can achieve this.
Also Avoid using any language that the average non-technical reader would not understand without a glossary.

5. Improve Your Reach:
Improving your SEO and Keywords game can do wonders when it comes to improving your reach on the Internet. If you can crack the way the page recommendation Algorithm works the internet is all yours.

Coming in the first page of any search engine is of utmost importance. Netizens don't often go to second pages of any search engine on searching for a topic. They tend to stay in the first page itself. So not being on the first page can cost you dearly when considering your reach

6. Time your releases:
Making a proper schedule to manage your daily content is very important. Blogs often need to post a minimum 2-3 articles per day to stay relevant. Timing your releeases according to the internet traffic in parts of a day is very important.

If your blog is regularly updated, it probably doesn’t matter exactly how frequently you post. But it is a good idea to space out posts over time to send a signal to search engines that your site is actively growing. Don’t dump lots of content onto your blog at once. Use the scheduling function in your CMS Service to space your blogs out over time.

7. Promotion:
Once you’ve actually published the post, you’re not done! If you want people to see what you’ve written and get value out of it, make sure to share it in the places where your audience is likely to hang out. This might include Facebook groups, Reddit, Hacker News, LinkedIn, or any other platform. Also, make sure to share your creation on your own social media accounts, like Twitter. Your friends will be excited to read, share, and upvote what you’ve written!

So to conclude Technical blogging isn't much different from Normal blogging. How you work on your blog is crucial for its growth. regular updates and staying true to your niche can do wonders when it comes to blogging.And now, you’re done so go get a coffee or or binge on some Anime as taking a blog post from start to finish is no small feat.
